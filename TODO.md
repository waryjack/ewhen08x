# To-Do

* Vehicle implementations - sheet, actions
* Rabble Sheet redesign + CSS - simplify, rearrange
* Ensure all sheet functionality is live. Current issues:
*   Updating resources (lifeblood, shield, etc) - done
*   Editing, adding, deleting, and rolling items
    * all items can be added / deleted; weapon and armor rolls working, as are career/stat rolls power rolls not yet implemented
* Add back tabbed sheet, if possible.
* Drag/drop implementation on actor sheets.
* Encumbrance, weights, etc.
* DataModel for system settings (to help with migrations)
* CSS work to make sure it's consistent across system; make item editing not all caps transformed!
